## Motivation

Dependency injection or inversion of control frameworks are awesome 99% of the time.
They are not so awesome when your tests fail in unexpected ways, or when your production build contains a class that belongs to a unit test.

My workmates and I therefore consider it a best practice to check the injected values during runtime.
If they match an abstract class, which we often use as our implementation interfaces, we let the app crash.
This has allowed us to catch bugs in the past and will make developing unit tests and predict their failures easier in the future.

Writing these runtime checks is however laborsome, error prone and repetitive.
I therefore generalized the problem and here we are.

## Usage

Currently, there are two flavours of injection checks:
 - [`throwIfMatches`](#throwifmatches) will throw an error if an instance of a class matches a class that is known to be incorrect one. Use this check whenever you need to be certain that you injected the correct class.
 - [`noDirectInstantiation`](#nodirectinstantiation) is a class decorator that adds a runtime check against direct instantiation. The class becomes an abstract class during runtime.

The usage of these approaches can be mixed.
My suggestion would be to use `noDirectInstantiation` in conjunction with good documentation about its behaviour. The usage of abstract classes in your codebase might also help prevent unexpected behaviour.
`throwIfMatches` is the more verbose and configurable variant of the two.

### `throwIfMatches`
The general usage is as follows:

```javascript
class A {}

class B extends A {}

const {throwIfMatches} = require("ioc-check/throwIfMatches");

const instance1 = new B(); // or create an instance any other way
const instance2 = new A(); // e.g. ioc and dep-inj

throwIfMatches(instance1, A); // ok
throwIfMatches(instance2, A); // throws DependencyInjectionError
```

Create instances of objects however you like, in this case by calling the constructor directly. In practice, you would
probably want to use a inversion of control framework or implement dependency injection yourself. <br>
Then, compare the instance of your object against a class that you know your instance should not be an instance of. In
this specific example the comparison of the instance of B against A will pass the check, since the classes do not match
exactly. However, the comparison of the instance of A against A will not pass the check, since A -and only A- matches A
exactly. Thus, a `DependencyInjectionError` will be thrown.

An example that is perhaps more realistic is as follows:

```typescript
import {throwIfMatches} from "ioc-check/throwIfMatches";
import {Inject} from "typescript-ioc";

abstract class Fruit {
    abstract takeABite();
}

class Apple extends Fruit {
    takeABite() {
        console.log("yummy ðŸ‘Œ nomnom ðŸ˜Š");
    }
}

class Human {
    private readonly food: Fruit;

    constructor(@Inject somethingToEat: Fruit) {
        throwIfMatches(somethingToEat, Fruit);
        this.food = somethingToEat;
    }
}
```

In this example we use **ioc-check** to check if the dependency injection by the popular **typescript-ioc** worked as
expected. Depending on how our ioc is configured, we could bind `Apple` to `Fruit` or leave `Fruit` unbound. The latter
could for example be the case in unit tests, or when developing new components for the existing application. Explicit
checks for the correct configuration are oftentimes required to catch oversights. In our example above, we would not
want to let `Fruit` be unbound, since we apparently need instances of the class to do something in `Human`. Thus the
check is introduced, if `Fruit` is bound to a subclass, or a different class that is similar enough for typescript type
checks to pass.

Depending on how `Fruit` is bound, we can now observe different behaviours during runtime.

```typescript
Container.bind(Fruit).to(Apple);
const steve = Container.get(Human);
```

In this case `steve` will be successfully instantiated as the ioc runtime check has passed. His `food` property will be
populated with a new `Apple` object.

```typescript
Container.bind(Fruit).to(Fruit); // or simply omit this line
const steve = Container.get(Human); // throws DependencyInjectionError reason Fruit
```

In this case `steve` will not be instantiated and a `DependencyInjectionError` will be thrown. His `food` property would
have been populated with a new `Fruit` object. In this example an instantiation with a `Fruit` would have been
nonsensical, since `Fruit` should only be instantiated through subclasses. Thankfully, our manual check
with `throwIfMatches` caught this potential bug.

One downside of this approach to dependency injection checks is that you have to manually test for the correct or
incorrect class. There is no built-in guarantee that you did not forget to check your classes.
To save yourself some time and the headache of manual test, check out `noDirectInstantiation`.

### `noDirectInstantiation`

Instead of adding these checks everywhere you need them, why not simply add the check to the class itself?
This is exactly what the class decorator function `noDirectInstantiation` does.
It essentially makes a class abstract during runtime.

The usage is pretty simple and much less verbose than the usage of `throwIfMatches` once you figure out how to enable 
decorator functions for your use case.
If you are using TypeScript, it is as easy as setting the configuration parameter `enableExperimentalDecorators` to `true`.

Let's revisit the example from before but slightly modified:
```typescript
import {noDirectInstantiation} from "ioc-check/noDirectInstantiation";

@noDirectInstantiation // add this decorator to prevent direct instantiation
abstract class Fruit {
    abstract takeABite();
}

class Apple extends Fruit {
    takeABite() {
       console.log("yummy ðŸ‘Œ nomnom ðŸ˜Š"); 
    }
}

new Apple(); // this is fine
// @ts-expect-error TypeScript does not like it when you instantiate an abstract class
new Fruit(); // throws DependencyInjectionError reason Fruit
```

`Fruit` cannot be directly instantiated after applying the decorator, only by extending it and then instantiating
the subclass.
Just like `throwIfMatches`, this is a very useful sanity check during runtime, especially in conjunction with
**typescript-ioc** or other dependency injection frameworks.
Since they do not know about abstract classes during runtime - this piece of information is lost after compiling - they
will happily create instances of your abstract classes.
With the addition of the decorator, they will however not be able to do so anymore.

```typescript
import {Inject} from "typescript-ioc";

class Human {
    private readonly food: Fruit;

    constructor(@Inject somethingToEat: Fruit) {
        this.food = somethingToEat;
    }
}
```

Depending on how `Fruit` is bound, its instantiation through **typescript-ioc** will now produce a runtime error, just
like in the example of `throwIfMatches`.
If `Fruit` is instantiated directly, it will now produce a runtime Error:

```
DependencyInjectionError: Fruit
  at [...]
```

The advantage of this approach is also it's biggest downside.
While you only have to configure this behaviour once and not explicitly check for the instances class type before usage,
this behaviour is also less apparent and slightly obscured.
It is also less flexible, since you might have cases where you can ignore the correct or incorrect instantiation.
For a more verbose, configurable but less robus approach, check out `throwIfMatches`.

## Installation

`npm i --save ioc-check`

The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ioc-check) contains the transpiled JavaScript code and TypeScript typings.
Both are generated from the TypeScript source code.
You do not need TypeScript to use this package.

Both flavors of decorators in TypeScript are supported: *experimental* and *TC39 proposal*, available from `typescript@^5`.

## Updates

**ioc-check** follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200).
This means that you can decide based on the version number of the package if manual update intervention is required.
Head over to [Github Releases](https://github.com/Miladiir/ioc-check-ts/releases) or check the CHANGELOG file for
changes between versions.
In most cases *npm* will take care of updates for you automatically with `npm update` or an alternative of your choice.

(Not recommended)
`npm i --save ioc-check@latest` will force the package to the latest version in any case.
